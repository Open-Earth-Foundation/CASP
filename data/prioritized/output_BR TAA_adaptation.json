            "explanation": "For the city Riverton, the action Bus Emissions was ranked lower despite its potential to reduce transport-related emissions because it does not directly address the most critical emission sources. The sector focus presents challenges in fully aligning with the city’s dominant emission profile. Additionally, potential implementation complexities and trade-offs in cost-effectiveness led to a relatively reduced prioritization."

            "explanation": "For the city Greenport, Urban Greening was not ranked as highly because its direct impact on reducing primary emission sources is limited. While it does offer environmental enhancements and improved urban aesthetics, the measure falls short in delivering rapid reductions in greenhouse gases. Its longer-term nature and reliance on additional supporting measures reduce its overall immediate climate impact."

            "actionPriority": -1,
            "explanation": "For the city Hillcrest, Public Transit Electrification was ranked lower because, despite its role in reducing emissions from transportation, it does not directly address the city’s most critical emission challenges. The strategy faces sector-specific hurdles and involves a relatively complex implementation pathway. Such factors have curtailed its overall potential compared to measures that more directly tackle the primary emission sources."

            "explanation": "For Sunnyside, Water Efficiency Programs were given a lower ranking as their direct impact on reducing major greenhouse gas emissions is limited. Although the initiative contributes positively to resource management, it does not address the city’s most dominant emission sectors. The associated implementation challenges and relatively modest benefits have collectively led to a reduced prioritization."

            "actionPriority": -1,
            "explanation": "For Oakwood, Reforestation Initiatives, while environmentally appealing, were ranked lower because their benefits in directly reducing urban greenhouse gas emissions are less immediate. The longer timeline required for trees to mature and sequester carbon limits short-term impact. Additionally, the dependency on natural growth processes means that supplementary measures might be necessary to achieve urgent climate mitigation objectives."

            "actionPriority": -1,
            "explanation": "For Mapleton, Heat Island Mitigation strategies were ranked lower as their impact on reducing the core sources of greenhouse gas emissions is more indirect. Although these initiatives improve urban comfort and local microclimates, they do not fully address critical emission sectors. The resulting trade-offs in terms of cost-effectiveness and implementation ease contributed to a lower overall prioritization."

            "actionPriority": -1,
            "explanation": "For Fairview, Energy Efficiency Retrofits were given a lower ranking because, while they enhance building performance, they fall short of transforming the city’s major emission sources at scale. The measure faces certain implementation challenges that may require broader systemic changes for full effectiveness. This comparatively limited scope in emissions reduction has led to a reduced prioritization within the overall climate action strategy."

            "actionPriority": -1,
            "explanation": "For Eastgate, Green Roof Installations were ranked lower because their benefits, while locally enhancing urban cooling and aesthetics, do not comprehensively tackle the city’s most pressing greenhouse gas challenges. The action faces more complex implementation requirements relative to its scale of impact. These factors, combined with a dependency on supplementary measures, have led to a reduced overall prioritization."

            "actionPriority": -1,
            "explanation": "For Newtown, Stormwater Management Systems were ranked lower as their focus is on water risk management rather than directly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The indirect contribution in emissions mitigation and the need for coordinated urban planning make their impact more gradual. These factors result in a less immediate benefit in the context of pressing climate challenges."
