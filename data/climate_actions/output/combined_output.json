This involves participatory approaches, structured decision-making tools, and decentralized frameworks that couple top-down management with community-driven initiatives. Additional strategies include collective water management systems to optimize resource use under climate-induced variability, indigenous water-sharing systems rooted in traditional practices to ensure sustainable and equitable resource allocation, and enforcing the land rights of Indigenous populations to protect biodiversity and cultural heritage. Adaptive co-management in Arctic fisheries integrates local and scientific knowledge to address climate impacts on marine resources. The international compact on migration fosters orderly and safe migration as an adaptive response to climate risks, and policies for adaptive governance promote ecosystem-based solutions, legal frameworks, and institutional adaptations to enhance resilience to climate change. These combined measures address geopolitical complexities, ensure equitable resource distribution, and strengthen resilience to climate-induced hazards.",
