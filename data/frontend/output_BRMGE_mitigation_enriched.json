This can help stimulate local economies and provide pathways for economic advancement.\n \n 5. **Community Engagement**: The development and implementation of building standards can involve community input, ensuring that the voices of underserved populations are heard and considered in decision-making processes. This fosters a sense of ownership and inclusion in climate action efforts.\n \n 6. **Long-term Sustainability**: By improving the sustainability of residential buildings, the action contributes to the resilience of communities that are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts, ensuring that they are better equipped to withstand environmental changes.\n \n Overall, the action integrates equity and inclusion by addressing the specific needs of underserved communities, promoting health and economic benefits, and ensuring community participation in the process.",
