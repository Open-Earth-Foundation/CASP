By discouraging excessive use of private vehicles, the toll could promote the use of public transportation and reduce traffic congestion. This action is particularly relevant given the city's high risk of public health impacts from heatwaves, which can be exacerbated by vehicle emissions. Additionally, reducing transportation emissions aligns with broader efforts to improve air quality and public health in the region. However, the socio-economic context, with a high percentage of low-income residents, must be considered to ensure the toll does not disproportionately impact vulnerable populations.",

This initiative can significantly reduce stationary energy emissions, which are currently a major contributor to the city's total emissions. Additionally, by increasing local energy production, the city can enhance its energy security, which is crucial given the high risk of energy insecurity due to droughts. Furthermore, community solar farms can provide economic benefits to the local population, particularly important in a region with high levels of low-income residents.",
