            "Description": "Establishing and maintaining early warning systems for disasters, including marine heatwaves, pest outbreaks, and heatwaves. These systems involve timely information dissemination to individuals, communities, and emergency services, enabling proactive measures to mitigate risks. Heat Action Plans (HAPs) are part of these systems and include detailed strategies like urban planning with nature-based solutions (e.g., green-blue spaces, cool materials), public awareness campaigns, and targeted measures for vulnerable groups (e.g., elderly, children, outdoor workers). Critical actions also include evaluation of system effectiveness post-disaster, lessons sharing, and improvements for better preparedness in future events.",
