Agroecological practices can help maintain ecological balance and reduce the risk of biodiversity loss, which is a concern given the city's vulnerability to climate hazards like droughts and heatwaves. Additionally, these practices can enhance food security by ensuring sustainable agricultural productivity, which is vital in a region with high socio-economic challenges and a significant risk of food insecurity due to climate impacts. Implementing this action aligns with the need to address both environmental sustainability and socio-economic resilience in Camet\u00e1.",
