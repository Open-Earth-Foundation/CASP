By integrating electric bikes, cities can further reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, and promote a healthier and more sustainable mode of transportation for both urban and rural areas. This initiative also supports mobility equality, as it makes bikes more accessible to a wider range of people.",
