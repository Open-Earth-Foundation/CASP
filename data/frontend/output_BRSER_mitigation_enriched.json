This can lead to more affordable utility costs for residents, benefiting low-income households.\n \n 2. **Healthier Living Environments**: The focus on sustainable urban development contributes to healthier living conditions, which is particularly important for vulnerable populations who may be disproportionately affected by poor housing quality and environmental hazards.\n \n 3. **Job Creation in Underserved Areas**: Implementing new building standards can create job opportunities in construction and related fields, particularly in communities that may lack economic resources. This can help uplift local economies and provide employment for residents.\n \n 4. **Community Resilience**: By promoting energy efficiency and sustainable practices, the action enhances the resilience of communities to climate impacts, which is crucial for vulnerable populations that may be more susceptible to climate-related challenges.\n \n 5. **Inclusive Policy Development**: The establishment of building standards often involves stakeholder engagement, which can include input from community members, particularly those from underserved backgrounds, ensuring that their needs and perspectives are considered in the development process. \n \n Overall, the action integrates equity and inclusion by ensuring that all communities, especially those that are vulnerable or underserved, benefit from sustainable building practices and improved living conditions.",
