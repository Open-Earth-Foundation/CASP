Additionally, these incentives can help mitigate the risks associated with droughts and heatwaves, which pose threats to biodiversity and energy security. Implementing such measures aligns with the city's need to improve its socio-economic conditions and access to public services, particularly in areas with inadequate water and sanitation.",
