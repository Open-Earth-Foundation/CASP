    "Description": "Implementing sustainable water supply systems by constructing irrigation infrastructure, promoting inter-basin water transfers, utilizing nature-based solutions (NBS) such as rain gardens, bioswales, and wetlands, and integrating advanced techniques like water reuse and water upgrading. Water reuse involves treating and recycling wastewater for non-potable or potable purposes, while water upgrading focuses on improving the quality of available water for diverse uses. These approaches enhance stormwater infiltration, improve urban water management, increase drought resilience, and support groundwater recharge. They provide energy-efficient and economical water solutions while maintaining sustainable urban development.",

Adaptive co-management in Arctic fisheries integrates local and scientific knowledge to address climate impacts on marine resources. The international compact on migration fosters orderly and safe migration as an adaptive response to climate risks, and policies for adaptive governance promote ecosystem-based solutions, legal frameworks, and institutional adaptations to enhance resilience to climate change. These combined measures address geopolitical complexities, ensure equitable resource distribution, and strengthen resilience to climate-induced hazards.",
