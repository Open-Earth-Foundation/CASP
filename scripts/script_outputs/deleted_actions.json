This ensures that all community members have safer access to these modes of transport.\n \n 3. **Reduction of Traffic Hazards**: By addressing traffic-related hazards, the action helps to create a safer urban environment for all residents, particularly those in low-income neighborhoods that may experience higher rates of traffic incidents.\n \n 4. **Community Engagement**: The implementation of such measures often involves community input, ensuring that the voices of underserved populations are heard and considered in the decision-making process, fostering a sense of ownership and inclusion.\n \n 5. **Health Benefits**: Improved road safety and reduced traffic speeds contribute to better air quality and lower noise pollution, which disproportionately affect low-income communities, thereby promoting health equity.\n \n Overall, this climate action recognizes and addresses the specific needs of vulnerable and underserved communities, ensuring that safety and accessibility are prioritized in urban planning.","GHGReductionPotential":null,"AdaptationEffectiveness":null,"CostInvestmentNeeded":"low","TimelineForImplementation":null,"Dependencies":["Collaboration with local government and law enforcement to enforce speed limits","Public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about the benefits of speed restrictions","Infrastructure investment for physical road safety measures such as speed bumps and pedestrian crossings","Data collection and analysis to assess traffic patterns and identify high-risk areas","Community engagement to gather input and support for the measures"],"KeyPerformanceIndicators":["Reduction in traffic-related accidents","Percentage decrease in average vehicle speeds","Increase in public transportation usage","Number of pedestrian and cyclist injuries","Public satisfaction with road safety measures","Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation","Increase in the number of active transportation users (walking, cycling)","Compliance rate with new speed limits"],"PowersAndMandates":null}
