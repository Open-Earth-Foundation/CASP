context_for_behavioral_change = """**Interventions:**
Interventions represent decisions made at all levels of government — local, regional, and national — such as laws passed, investments decided upon, and strategies agreed upon. 
They are foundational directives that include measures like establishing 30 km/h zones, implementing all-weather cycle parking, installing dynamic traffic lights, imposing fuel taxes, and increasing peak-hour charges. 
Interventions set the stage for changes in the local environment that can drive the desired activity shifts.
These interventions influence attributes, which are measurable characteristics of the city or system that drive behaviour change.

**Attributes:** 
The attributes are tangible, observable outcomes of interventions. 
They include measurable elements such as traffic safety, cycle parking availability, average cycling speed, fuel prices, and road tolls. 
These characteristics reflect the implementation of interventions.

A behaviour change occurs when a person is presented with an alternative option, so attributes can either encourage or discourage specific behaviours. 
If an alternative is perceived as safer, simpler, more affordable, and so on, than the status quo, it becomes more appealing. 
An example of an encouraging attribute would be reducing the cost of public transportation to be less than purchasing fuel for a car trip of the same distance. 
On the other side, a discouraging attribute could be increasing the cost of public parking spaces, to make travelling by car more inconvenient.

**Behavioural Changes**: 
Behavioural changes are the changes in practices by the population (or parts of the population) whose behaviour is influenced by the perceptions formed from the attributes.
How the city's population perceives these attributes, which can encourage or discourage different behaviours, varyies across different demographics. 
It includes aspects such as safety, convenience, status, health, and affordability. 

### Comment: From here on I am getting a bit confused about behvarioral change and activity shift.
### The notion page keeps talking about activity shift however we want to extract behavioral change. To me it seems almost like the same thing - not sure
# The list of perceptions presented by the taxonomy is based on multiple theories of behaviour change and useful patterns of human perceptions. 
# It is intended to serve as examples rather than to be prescriptive and these examples cannot be considered mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) in practice as it is not possible for a list of this nature to be comprehensive or exhaustive.
